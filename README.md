# About the project  
This is the repository for Master's thesis project "Identifying Clones and Quantifying Diversity in B Cell Receptor Repertoire Sequencing data".

# Packages to Install and Virtual Environment
Create a virtual environment from the thesis_env.yml file using conda:

`conda env create -f thesis_env.yml`

The first line of the `.yml` file sets the new environment's name. 

# Others
* In order to be able to replicate the results, please change the directory in all scripts `do_*.py`.

* The simulated datasets are downloaded from https://zenodo.org/record/4009638#.YPHFMegzY2w
